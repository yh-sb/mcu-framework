    to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
    specified, or call vTaskDelay()). If the application makes use of the
    vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also
    important that vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling

    memory allocated by the kernel to any task that has since been deleted. */
